# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecostem are summarized.

# **Objectives**
# - List popular languages in data science
# - List commonly used libraries in data science
# - Create a single column chart
# - Create simple arithmetic expresions
# 
#   

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. SQL
# 3. R

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. Matplotlib
# 2. Pandas
# 3. NumPy

# |Data Science Tools|

# |Apache Spark|
# |Apache Hadoop|
# |TensorFlow|

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arimetic expressions in Python.
# 

# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers. 

# In[109]:


(3*4)+5


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60

# In[111]:


hours,minutes = divmod(200,60)
print (hours,minutes)
